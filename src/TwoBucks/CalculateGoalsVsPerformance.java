 * Calculate Goals vs. Actual Performance US.10

 * The CalculateGoalsVsPerformance class is used when the user wants
 * to view their statistics of their performance compared to their
 * set goals. It will follow the pipe and filter architecture because
 * it uses data from other portions of the program, and outputs information
 * based on that data
